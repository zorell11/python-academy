Je to perfektní jazyk pro ty, co se chtějí naučit programovat.Welcome to Python Beginner! This course is a combination of in-person lectures and self-study. In the first lesson, we will discuss Python´s basics - its origin, installation, usage, running scripts in Python and elementary data types. Let´s start!Conditions. That´s topic of this lesson. Conditions are crucially important for every single programmer. By using conditions, your code can act upon decisions you set. Let´s deepen your Python skills.Hi there! So far you know how to use conditions and basic data sets. It is high time to learn next Python´s useful tool - dictionaries. Don´t be afraid, it is just another type of data set.In this lesson, you will find out, how important are loops. Automation can save you a huge amount of time and effort, especially when repeating some boring steps. Lines of Python code with loops are much more functional than a basic ones.Text Analyzer is a program, which can browse any type of text and reveal many information about it. You will brush up on working with text and basic concepts. Go for it!You have studied basics about loops in last lesson. Now it´s time to deepen your knowledge with For loops and Ranges. For loops and Ranges are more powerful tool than basic loops - let's begin right away!You know how to use data types, conditions and loops. Way to go! We can move to a little bit more serious issue- functions! This concept is must-have for every Python programmer, as it saves a lot of time and effort. Dive into another lesson!Function Scopes and Inputs. That´s the topic of another lesson and boost of functions. You will learn, how to type code to create function with random amount of arguments and much more.String formatting? Great way of automatization within Python code. Just imagine, you need to browse hundreds of data with various values. When using strings, you work is gonna be so much easier. Let´s start!Your task is to create the car rental database, which enables you to compare different cars based on various parameters. You will go through working with files and data type dictionary.Nobody is perfect. We bet, you have made a mistake in your Python code at least once. Therefore, we will focus on the methods of debugging. It comes in handy, since your code is more complex than it used to be.Modul is a block of code typed by someone else. You can edit this block, add some functionality or alter it in some different ways. But first, you need to import this module. In lesson 10, we will discuss importing.You are able to cope with text files, but what about table formats? File formats and JSON are topic of the penultimate lesson. Keep working, you are almost finished!The last lesson is dedicated to scraping. Thanks to scraping, you can get diverse data about various web pages and use them within your projects. Scraping is very useful tool of every skilled programmer. Let´s dive into scraping.The final project will find out, what skills have you gained not only in the last lessons, but throughout whole course. Properly designed Election scraper will fetch data directly from the web. Let´s do it!You can get a taste of functional programming tools by learning iteration protocol, comprehensions and functions as map, filter, reduce. Important part of functional programming is the use of anonymous (lamba) functions.We'll take you to the world of recursion and recursive functions. You'll also master factory functions, that make our code to look more object oriented. Finally, we need to get familiar with date and time operations in Python, represented by the datetime module.You'll learn how iterator-like object can be created in form of generators. We then shift to a new topic of regular expressions and at the end, we'll show you package importing.Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world.In this project, you will create an application which will behave as a company HR System. Your HR System will have basic interface of terminal window. Therefore all the interaction will be keyboard based and not mouse based. HR System contains employee related data." />

  <h2>Welcome to Python Academy</h2>
  <section><p>Hi there! We are excited to welcome you in our Python Academy. This course consists of 12 in-person lectures and self-study in Online portal, where you can find dozens of exercises, articles about theory and complex projects. In case of any problem, feel free to use our live chat (blue icon in the bottom right corner).</p>
<p>Let´s start with lesson 1. We will discuss the basics of Python:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is it,</li>
<li>how to install it,</li>
<li>how to write scripts in Python,</li>
<li>Python data types</li>
<li>and more.</li>
</ul>
</section>
  <h2>Course Structure</h2>
  <section><p>Python Academy consists of:</p>
<h3>12 in-person lessons</h3>
<p>We meet once a week, always at 18:00. Our focus during in-person lessons is to explain new concepts and answer your questions - <strong>OnSite</strong> part. Because we are limited just to 3 hours a week, there's a need to continue learning at home.</p>
<p>So in order to be successful, you may need to revise what we've discussed in the <strong>Theory</strong> sections, and then you'll certainly need to test your knowledge in the <strong>Quizzes</strong> and try new concepts on tasks inside <strong>Home exercise</strong> sections.</p>
<p>Our data show that without exceptions, best graduates are the ones who completed most exercises. If you don't have time during one week, that's fine. Try to work on exercises another week. Just think about the fact, that practice is the king.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes there will be <strong>Theory +</strong> sections. If you aim to be serious about programming, it is a good idea to take a look at this section too ;). Here's an <a href="/study/lesson/_zXb/unit/_P8G" target="_blank">example</a> of such section.</p>
<p>And lastly, there will be few exercises which will have the <strong>[H]</strong> sign which stands for <strong>Hacker</strong>. These exercises are still easy for some, but harder for others. They are not necesarily super advanced, but maybe just a bit larger in scope. If you feel up for a challenge, we recommend those as well. Here's an <a href="/study/lesson/_zXb/unit/_kZL" target="_blank">example</a> of such lesson - notice the <strong>[H]</strong> in the title.</p>
<p>To conclude, each lesson consists of the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Review Exercises (from lesson 2 onwards)</li>
<li>OnSite Part,</li>
<li>Theory,</li>
<li>Theory +,</li>
<li>Quiz,</li>
<li>and Home Exercises.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3 big projects</h3>
<p>At the end of each month you'll get to work on a project that should test the knowledge you have acquired so far. We'll be there to give you feedback, shall you need it :)</p>
<p>Every project lesson includes a review test, which you should complete before diving into the project itself ;)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/study/lesson/_pVw/unit/_BYZL" target="_blank">Project 1 review test</a></li>
<li><a href="/study/lesson/_wX8/unit/_nA3x" target="_blank">Project 2 review test</a></li>
<li><a href="/study/lesson/_A6J/unit/_XkRx" target="_blank">Project 3 review test</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>2 small projects</h3>
<p>You'll also have 2 optional projects at your disposal - the Black Jack game and the HR System. These projects are additional practise to test your programming capabilities.</p>
<p>The Black Jack game includes the - <a href="/study/lesson/_PXp/unit/_dg7X" target="_blank">last review test!</a></p>

  <h2>Basics of command line</h2>
  <h2>Installing Python</h2>
  <section><p>Now let's look how to install Python to you computer. We'll go over 3 different OS (Operating Systems) starting with Windows.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>You can download Python installer from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank">Python website</a>. Choose the most up-to-date version of Python 3. It is usually the link at the top of the list.</p>
</section>
  <section><p>When you click on the latest release you get to a page where at the bottom, you will find multiple Python installation packages to download. You should select only one - based on Windows system type - 64 or 32 bit. So let's say you have the 64 bit:</p>
</section>
  <section><p>To find out which system type you have, you will need to go to: <code>Start -> Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> System type</code>.<br>
You will most probably want to choose the 64-bit version.</br></p>
</section>
  <section><p>While installing, you have the possibility to tick the following options. <strong>Please tick them</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Install launcher for all Users</li>
<li>Add Python <release> to PATH</release></li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards you can click on <strong>Install Now</strong>.
<br/></p>
</section>
  <section><h3>Mac</h3>
<p>Install Homebrew Package Manager on your Mac. Open the terminal window and paste following command in:<br/></p>
<div data-component="CodeBlock" data-props="{"language":null,"code":"/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n"}"/><p>Then install python using the command below:<br/></p>
<div data-component="CodeBlock" data-props="{"language":null,"code":"brew install python3\n"}"/><h3>Linux</h3>
<p>If you have <strong>Ubuntu</strong> you can write into your terminal:<br/></p>
<div data-component="CodeBlock" data-props="{"language":null,"code":"sudo apt-get install python3\n"}"/><p>In case of <strong>CentOS or Fedora</strong> you don't need to do anything. Python 3 is by default installed on Fedora and latest CentOS.</p>

  <h2>Installing pip</h2>
  <h2>The Flow of Working with Python</h2>
  <section><p>We have installed Python, Editor and Pip. Also, we know the basics of commmand line. We are ready to learn, how to work with the Python code.</p>
<h3>Editor + command line</h3>
<p>In the following steps, we'll see how we could work with our code editor and command line together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the working file 'PythonBeginner' in your home directory:</li>
</ol>
<table>

<tr><td style="text-align:center">Mac</td><td style="text-align:center"><code>/Users/<username>/PythonBeginner</code></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol start="2">
<li><p>Open your editor and in it a new file</p></li>
<li><p>Write the following text in the new file: <code>print('Hello Python')</code></p></li>
<li><p>Save this file under the name <strong>first.py</strong> into the working file - PythonBeginner.
<br/></p></li>
<li><p>Open your command line:<br/></p></li>
</ol>

</tbody>

<ol start="6">
<li>With command line get to your working directory (where your new Python file is located)<br/></li>
</ol>

</tbody>
</table>
<ol start="7">
<li><p>Run Python file by writing its name into the command line: <code>first.py</code></p></li>
<li><p>The result should look like this:</p></li>
</ol>
<div data-component="CodeBlock" data-props="{"language":null,"code":"Hello Python\n"}"/></section>
  <section><h3>Command line - interactive mode</h3>
<p>Sometimes we need to quickly try what does certain Python expression do. For this it's better to work only with command line in the interactive mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>To start the interactive session we use the command <code>python</code>.</li>
<li>To end the interactive session we write <code>quit()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>
<div data-component="CodeBlock" data-props="{"language":null,"code":"> python\nPython 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:54:40) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> 1+1\n2\n>>> quit()\n>\n"}"/><p><strong>Unix (Linux/Mac)</strong></p>
